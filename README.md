INTRODUCTION
This  project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to uncover patterns, causes, and consequences of crashes across various trafficway types and time periods. The dataset includes detailed attributes such as crash dates, weather and lighting conditions, crash types, road defects, contributing causes, injuries, and damages. The primary objective of this analysis is to identify high-risk areas and trends in crash occurrences to support data-driven recommendations for improving road safety.
Recommendations and Observations
Based on the analysis of the traffic accident dataset from 2018 to 2025, several critical observations and actionable recommendations emerged. These are intended to support traffic authorities, urban planners, and public safety officials in reducing crash frequency and severity.
Observations
High Frequency at Not Divided Trafficways: This road type recorded the highest number of injuries, particularly in 2018. Combined with frequent intersection involvement, this suggests a need for improved control measures in these areas.


"Unable to Determine" as Leading Cause: This repeated value limits the depth of analysis into root causes. It indicates potential data collection or reporting issues at the crash scene.


Angle and Turning Crashes Dominate: These crash types are the most prevalent across all years and trafficway types, indicating maneuvering and visibility challenges.


Most Crashes Occur in Clear Conditions: The majority of incidents happened under clear weather and dry surface conditions, suggesting that human error plays a larger role than environmental factors.


Damage Costs Skewed High: Most crashes involved damage exceeding $1,500, indicating a high financial toll even when injuries are not severe.


Recommendations
Install Better Traffic Control Devices at High-Risk Intersections
 Enhanced signage, traffic lights, and roundabouts should be considered for high-crash intersections, particularly Y and Four-Way types.


Improve Data Collection at Crash Scenes
 Training for field officers or automated reporting systems could help reduce the number of cases labeled “Unable to Determine,” allowing for clearer root cause analysis.


Target Driver Education on Turning and Angle Maneuvers
 Educational campaigns or mandatory re-training may be beneficial, especially in areas where such crash types are most common.


Implement Speed Control and Monitoring
 Given the high impact crashes (in terms of damage), speed monitoring technologies like speed cameras should be installed, especially in straight roads and undivided trafficways.


Use Time-Based Interventions
 Since crash volumes spike during certain hours and days, targeted enforcement during peak times can reduce traffic violations and collisions.


Prioritize Road Safety Improvements in “Not Divided” Trafficways
 These roads need attention for lane separation, speed calming, and better visibility at junctions.


Leverage Power BI Dashboards for Ongoing Monitoring
 Stakeholders can use the interactive dashboard to continuously track traffic safety metrics and quickly identify new risk trends.
